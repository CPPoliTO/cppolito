                <h2>SWERC 2022</h2>

                <p>
                    Sunday, April 24th, has taken place the 2021-2022 edition of SWERC (South-Western
                    European Regional Contest). We have partecipated for the second consecutive
                    year and, for the first time, we have enrolled three teams:
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>PoliTO1 (46th classified):</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Federico Fortunati</li>
                            <li>Francesco Imparato</li>
                            <li>Marco Sorbi</li>
                        </ul>

                        <br />
                    
                        <li>PoliTO2 (52nd classified):</li>
                        <ul> 
                            <li>Abdelrahman Abdelwahab</li>
                            <li>Zyad Barakat</li>
                            <li>Lorenzo Nikiforos</li>
                        </ul>

                        <br />
                    
                        <li>PoliTO3 (85th classified):</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Soheila Amiri</li>
                            <li>Mohammad Valipour</li>
                            <li>Sadjad Zamani</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                    
                <h3>SWERC</h3>
                    
                <p>
                    SWERC is the qualification contest for ICPC (International Collegiate
                    Programming Contest) for the south-western Europe (with the addition of
                    Israel), in which Italian Universities can partecpiate.

                    <br /><br />

                    This year, for the first time, the competition has been organized by the
                    Politecnico di Milano, after last year's online edition.
                    
                    <br /><br />

                    The contest is made up of usually 12 problems to solve in the minimum time
                    possible, for each minute used to solve one problem a penalty point is added
                    to your score. Penalty points are used in the case in which two (or more)
                    teams solved the same number of problems (the less the better).
                    This year, the first classified team (Raw Pots of Harbour.Space University)
                    has solved ten of the twelve provided problems.
                    
                <h3>Our teams</h3>

                <p>
                    Since, this year, the number of request of partecipation was greater than
                    the maximum number of people we could enroll to the contest, we organized
                    a "selection contest" open to everyone who was IPCP-elegible. After the
                    selection, we made a ranking based on the results of the contests and then
                    we created the groups of three that we registered for the competition.
                    
                    <br /><br /><br />

                    Lastly, we would like to thank DAUIN to letting us partecipate, professor
                    Giovanni Squillero to have been our connection point between us and the
                    department and SWERC organization, to Politecnico di Milano and all the staff
                    members and people who made the competition possible.
